#### myself

Hi, I am Guan Lili, a second year graduate student majoring in software engineering. I love technology and life, and have had two test development internship experiences. Like to record the problems encountered in study and work in the form of documents. To yourself, fight against forgetting. To others, helpful.

#### Postscript

The blog of guanlili is now open.

In 2019, there is finally a place to write something well.

As a programmer, it would be boring if the wheel of Blog is hung on the popular blog program. I have tried many blogs, CSDN, Jianshu, Open Source China, etc. First, I think most of the blog services are too ugly, and second, I think itâ€™s not fun to customize it. Because I was too lazy and didn't toss about it before, I didn't even have a place to write something.

Lu Xun said: The best time to write a blog is ten years ago, followed by now.

I hope I can go through here and insist on writing something, whether it is technology or life. To borrow a sentence from Steve Jobs's speech at Stanford University: "you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards."
